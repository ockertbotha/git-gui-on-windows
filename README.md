Which git GUI tools to use on Windows?

For simple installation and ease of use let's look at:
1. [GitKraken](#1-gitkraken)
2. [Sourcetree](#2-sourcetree)
3. [Eclipse-Egit](3-eclipse-egit)

## Introduction
You're interested in using git? You know and use Windows? You want the setup to
be as easy as running an installer and maybe a bit of configuration?

There are many tools to provide various levels of git functionality
on Windows, from replicating the CLI tools available in the Unix based
OSes to the easy to install and use GUI centric options.

Since Windows has started playing so nicely with Linux and Microsoft's
acquisition of Github there's every chance we will see more native Windows tools
becoming available but until then:

Let's have a look at the most convenient and comprehensive options.
*'(Which I've used up to this point!)'*

## 1. GitKraken
This tool from the team at Axosoft is probably the best looking and most
polished tool available, that it runs equally well on Windows, Linux and Mac
is just brilliant.

It is feature and option rich, with a bit of digging you could make it look and
work just like you want it to. It is very easy to just start using at a very
basic level and learn some of the more advanced features along the way.

You will need to create an account at
[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) and download the relevant
installer from there. I have installed and used the client on Windows, Mac and
Linux without any issues.

Probably the only negative I can aim at GitKraken is that once the product left
the beta stage and had to become commercially viable they really pushed the
licensing options. There is no licensing option that suits me. In fairness
the product has always had a free-to-use option and the licensing messages
can now be turned off. But not before it annoyed me enough to look around
at alternatives.

## 2. Sourcetree
This tool is from the Atlassian team, it seems equally easy to use and
just as comprehensive. In truth I've not used it anywhere near as much as
GitKraken but so far so good.

It looks and feels like a more traditional Windows application, this might
be more to some tastes. It certainly seems good at displaying
the most important information where a Windows user would expect it.

You will need to create an account at
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) and download the relevant installer
from here. I have only tried the Windows client, and this after having tried
several other options, Sourcetree didn't need me to do anything more than I had
already done for the others but unlike with GitKraken where I can confirm it
truly is a one-stop installation I'm not sure about Sourcetree, the support
documentation indicate that it is but I'll update this information when I do
my next fresh Windows installation.

The only negative I'll aim at Sourcetree is not having a Linux client. But for
now I'm treating it's Linux absence as a reason to stay CLI fit on that OS.

## 3. Eclipse-Egit
Firstly this is not a stand-alone tool and refers to Eclipse's integrated
git functionality. I've only used it on Linux and there it seems to be pretty
good. So if you already use Eclipse on Windows then start with
[Egit](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/) it might be all you need!

For beginners there is a portion of this
[guide](https://github.com/ockertbotha/java-dev-on-ubuntu#4-version-control-with-git-and-eclipse-egit) that covers using Egit, even thought it is on Unbuntu, the Egit part should
still be relevant on Windows.

## Summary
There are of course more tools than this and a quick search may reveal that one
of the tools you currently use has a git plugin or equivalent, this is also an
ever changing landscape so keep up to date.

The three tools in this list are a great place to start using git and on Windows
at least they really simplify the installation and bring it inline with what
a Windows user is more familiar with.
